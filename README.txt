Project Description
Background
o A Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is an NP-complete problem. A salesman is
given a list of cities and a cost to travel between each pair of cities (or a list of city
locations). The salesman must select a starting city and visit each city exactly one
time and return to the starting city. His problem is to find the route (also known as a
Hamiltonian Cycle) that will have the lowest cost. (See http://www.tsp.gatech.edu for
more info)

• Problem
o Read: “Wisdom of the Crowds in Traveling Salesman Problems” by Sheng Kung
Michael Yi, Mark Steyvers, Michael D. Lee and Matthew J. Dry.
o Modify you GA from Programming Assignment 4 to utilize the Wisdom of Crowds
o Test data will be supplied, but also generate your own test cases

Solved by taking in the top performing children out of all the generations and
using the most popular city at each index to form the final wisdom of crowds solution.
Performed the same as the GA at best with current implementation.
